## Website live on : 

https://tinder-clone-lavakush07.vercel.app/


## Inspiration :

This project is inspired from the idea about a messaging and dating app. So I made a tinder clone project to resemble it.Through tinder-clone people can meet new people and can start dating. Btw I have never used the tinder in my real lifeðŸ˜….

## How it works :

If you swipe the tinder card towards *left* the person gets into your favourites list and by swipping towards *right* the person gets rejected.

## How I built it ðŸ‘·:

This project was built by using ***Javascript,React.js,CSS,HTML***. Later I have deployed it on vercel.

## Challenges I ran into ðŸ¥²:

I learnt how to deploy the website on the *vercel* server and got good grip upon many react topics like hooks,props.

## What's next for tinder-clone proj :

I would add chat section, so that people can start chatting with their friends.
